What is an endpoint [NOT API endpoints --> Queue endpoint + topic endpoint]

 An endpoint refers to a unique address or location within the messaging infrastructure where messages can be sent, received, or consumed.

For Queue Endpoints:

In the case of message queues, a queue endpoint represents a destination where messages are placed by producers and retrieved by consumers. Each queue has a distinct endpoint associated with it. Consumers can connect to this endpoint to receive and process messages in the order they were added to the queue.

For Topic Endpoints:

In publish-subscribe systems, a topic endpoint is a virtual channel or category to which messages can be published by producers. Consumers (subscribers) interested in specific topics can connect to the corresponding topic endpoint to receive messages related to that topic. Unlike queues, where each message is consumed by a single consumer, topics allow multiple consumers to subscribe to the same topic and receive copies of the published messages.

What is High Availability Architecture?

-->High Availability (HA) architecture is an approach to designing and implementing systems that ensure a high level of operational continuity, even in the face of hardware failures, software glitches, network issues, or other types of disruptions.
