 Commands available in the current mode:
       [create|no] acl-profile       - Create, modify, or delete a ACL
                                       Profile.

                                       An ACL Profile controls whether an
                                       authenticated client is permitted to
                                       establish a connection with the message
                                       broker or permitted to publish and
                                       subscribe to specific topics.
       [create|no] bridge            - Create, modify, or delete a Bridge.

                                       Bridges can be used to link two Message
                                       VPNs so that messages published to one
                                       Message VPN that match the topic
                                       subscriptions set for the bridge are
                                       also delivered to the linked Message
                                       VPN.
       [create|no] client-username   - Create, modify, or delete a Client
                                       Username.

                                       A client is only authorized to connect
                                       to a Message VPN that is associated
---Press any key to continue, or `q' to quit---
                                       with a Client Username that the client
                                       has been assigned.
       [create|no] distributed-cache - Create, modify, or delete a Distributed
                                       Cache.

                                       A Distributed Cache is a collection of
                                       one or more Cache Clusters that belong
                                       to the same Message VPN. Each Cache
                                       Cluster in a Distributed Cache is
                                       configured to subscribe to a different
                                       set of topics. This effectively divides
                                       up the configured topic space, to
                                       provide scaling to very large topic
                                       spaces or very high cached message
                                       throughput.

                                       Java Naming and Directory Interface

                                       Topic, and Queue on the router.
            message-spool            - Use this command to configure message
                                       spool parameters for Guaranteed

---Press any key to continue, or `q' to quit---
                                       VPN.

                                       Message VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
                                       allow for the segregation of topic
                                       space and clients. They also group
                                       clients connecting to a network of
                                       message brokers, such that messages
                                       published within a particular group are
                                       only visible to that group's clients.
       [create|no] routing           - Enter routing configuration mode

                                       accounts. The no version deletes the
                                       specified user. Deleting a user will
                                       also cause all SEMP sessions associated
                                       with the user to be deleted.
       [no] web-manager              - Use this command to access commands
